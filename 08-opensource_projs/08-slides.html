# Law of the Instrument

## "I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail." - Abraham Maslow, 1966

---
# Polyglot Programmer

--

## Using the right tool for every job means everything you do is a little bit easier (or better, or faster, or all of the above).

--

## Knowing multiple programming paradigms expands your mind and makes you better at programming in every language.

## Datastores (MySQL, PostgreSQL, CouchDB, Redis)
## Caching systems (Memcached, Varnish)
## Queueing systems (RabbitMQ, ZeroMQ, AMPQ, Beanstalkd)
## RPC protocols (REST, Thrift, Protocol Buffers)
## Serialization protocols (XML, Yaml, JSON)

# Go - Why?

## Go fast!

## Make programming fun again.

--

# Make the language fast.
# Make the tools fast.

---
# Java runs on the JVM

![](images/goperf1.png)

---
# Go runs directly on underlying hardware.

---
# Garbage Collected

## Pointers but no pointer arithmetic
## Variables are zero-initialized
## Array access is bounds-checked

--

## No dangling pointers
## No more malloc(), free()!

--

## **No buffer overflows**!

---
# Why isn't programming fun?

### Compiled, statically-typed languages (C, C++, Java) require too much typing and too much thinking:
* verbose, lots of repetition
* too much focus on type hierarchy
* types get in the way as much as they help
* compiles take far too long

### Dynamic languages (Python, JavaScript) fix these problems (no more types, no more compiler) but introduce others:
* errors at run time that should be caught statically
* no compilation means slow code

--

## Can we combine the best of both?

---
# Go Language Summary

### Methods: on any type, orthogonal to type system.
### Static types: enough to compile well, but inferred much of the time.
### Abstract types: interface values, relations inferred statically.
### Safe: lightweight feel of a scripting language but compiled.
### Concurrency: lightweight way to start new thread of control.
### Synchronization: explicit, easy message passing.

## Lawrence Krubner

# "There are many beautiful ideas that people associate with OOP. I am going to show 2 things:"

## 1.) compared to other languages OOP languages have no unique strengths

## 2.) compared to other languages OOP languages inflict a heavy burden of unneeded complexity

---
## Lawrence Krubner

# "Those features which are potentially good (data hiding, contract enforcement, polymorphism) are not unique to OOP and, in fact, stronger versions of these things are available in non-OOP languages. Those features that are unique to OOP (dependency injection, instantiation) are awful and exist only because OOP is awful."

# Movio: Why Golang made sense

# It's simple to learn
### "It took some of us six months including some after hours MOOCs, to be able to get relatively comfortable with Scala. In contrast, we picked up ‘Go’ in two weeks."

---
# Movio: Why Golang made sense
# Simpler code is more readable code
### "No map, no flatMap, no fold, no generics, no inheritance… Do we miss them? Perhaps we did, for about two weeks."

---
# Movio: Why Golang made sense
# Channels and goroutines have made our job so much easier
### "It's not just the fact that channels and goroutines are cheaper in terms of resources, compared to threadpool-based Futures and Promises, resources being memory and CPU. They are also easier to reason about when coding."

---
# Movio: Why Golang made sense
# It compiles fast and runs fast

## "Our Go microservices currently:"

* Build in 5 seconds or less
* Test in 1 or 2 seconds
* Run in our CI infrastructure in less than half a minute
* Deploy new containers in 10 seconds or less
* Tiny containers: average Go docker container is 16.5MB, vs 220MB for Scala
* Low-memory footprint: recently, movio rewrote a crucial service from Scala to Go: from 4G to 300M for the worst-case scenario
* Fast starts and fast shutdowns: just a binary; no need to start a VM

# Integrated circuits will lead to such wonders as home computers–or at least terminals connected to a central computer–automatic controls for automobiles, and personal portable communications equipment. - Moore, 1965

# “Modern processors are a like nitro fueled funny cars, they excel at the quarter mile. Unfortunately modern programming languages are like Monte Carlo, they are full of twists and turns.” — David Ungar

---
# The C10k Problem

# "Thread per connection" approach is conceptually neat, but doesn't scale well in practice.
# What does scale well (event-driven callbacks, asynchronous APIs) are harder to understand, maintain, and debug.
---
# Concurrency
## Hoare 1977: Communicating Sequential Processes

## Threads and locks are concurrency primitives; CSP is a concurrency model
## Learning CSP changes the way you think about concurrent programming

---
# In traditional concurrent programs, you communicate by sharing memory. In Go, you share memory by communicating.

# Concurrency
## Cheap to create a new flow of control (goroutine):

```
func main() {
    go expensiveComputation(x, y, z)
    anotherExpensiveComputation(a, b, c)
}
```
## Two expensive computations in parallel.

---
# Synchronization

## Use explicit messages to communicate and synchronize.

```
func computeAndSend(ch chan int, x, y, z int) {
    ch <- expensiveComputation(x, y, z)
}

func main() {
    ch := make(chan int)
    go computeAndSend(ch, x, y, z)
    v2 := anotherExpensiveComputation(a, b, c)
    v1 := <-ch
    fmt.Println(v1, v2)
}
```

# Project Health and Sustainable Open Source

# "Sustainable open source is an open source project that supports itself."

# "Capable of delivering improvements and fixing problems with its products in a timely manner, and that the project itself has a reasonable prospect of continuing into the future."

### Un-un-publishing is an unprecedented action that we're taking given the severity and widespread nature of breakage, and isn't done lightly," Voss explained about an hour ago.

### "This action puts the wider interests of the community of NPM users at odds with the wishes of one author; we picked the needs of the many. This whole situation sucks. We will be carefully considering the issues raised by and publishing a post-mortem later.

### "In the meantime, several thousand open source projects have been repaired, and I'm sleeping fine tonight."
