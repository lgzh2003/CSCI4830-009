## Planned contribution (1-3 sentences):
Currently, it's quite tedious to be able to run sublime from the command line on a mac (you have to set path variables and mess with certain directories/file structures, etc). So, I'd like to create a script that will help users bypass this process and begin running Sublime via command line.

## Why this project is meaningful to me (1-3 sentences):
I always want to just type '$ sublime \<file>' and have sublime pop up, but it never works! I think I would actually appreciate an easy fix to get sublime command line up and running. 

## Why this contribution is meaningful to the project (1-3 sentences):
I think there could be quite a community around sublime command line tools. It's one of the more popular editors out there, and I think lots of people would want to make it more accessible to a shell.
