# Student Name: Dylan McKinney

## Planned contribution (1-3 sentences): I intend to start this project. I want to offer slack users a variety of navigation tools available via a slack bot. The first tool I want to implement is one which allows a user to jump the conversation back to the first message after he or she was last online. 

## Why this project is meaningful to me (1-3 sentences): I use slack all the time. Many of my slack teams are very fast moving and can be difficult to catch up on when offline for an extended period of time. That is where the first tool idea came from, I think it would be incredibly useful for myself and those I am in slack teams with.

## Why this contribution is meaningful to the project (1-3 sentences): This contribution is meaningful to slack as a whole. Slack has a similar idea implemented in it already, but I have noticed it does not work well at all. I almost never use their version of this, and think I could make a better one.
