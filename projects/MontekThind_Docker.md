Project URL: https://github.com/docker/docker

Planned contribution (1-3 sentences): Docker is an open source project to pack, ship and run any application as a lightweight container. I will start my contribution by fixing typos/documentation while understanding the product and implemented features in it. Later i will fix some beginner coding problems. Once i get comfortable with the product and with GO, i will try to implement some additional features as requested in the issues.

Why this project is meaningful to me (1-3 sentences): I always wanted to learn a newer systems level programming language. Docker is entirely built in GO language, and this will help me in proving an opportunity to learn a newer technology aand a new programming language.

Why this contribution is meaningful to the project (1-3 sentences): Docker is been used everywhere for virtualization. My contribution from doing slight changes in the documentation to implementing a new feature can help users greatly. My contributions could potentially help the users who are looking to use Docker in their field.
