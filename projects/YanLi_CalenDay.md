## Why this project is meaningful to me (1-3 sentences):

One time, my teacher told me to draw a pie chart showing my day. I found the most of my time was spent on those things which I didn't think it is important for me. I never found it before I draw that chart. Time is important for everyone, but we don't use it efficiently as we think. Time visualization will help us to deal with this problem.
