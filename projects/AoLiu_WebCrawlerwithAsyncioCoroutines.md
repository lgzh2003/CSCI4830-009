## Planned contribution (1-3 sentences): 

I'd like to implement the web crawler with asyncio coroutines. I'll follow the instruction in "500 Lines or Less".

"500 Lines or Less" contains many great open source projects. However, there is only explaination but no source code. I'd like to implement it and help other to learn.
