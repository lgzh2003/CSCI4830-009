## Planned contribution (1-3 sentences):

I plan on contributing to the documentation of this project. The issues on github for this project are focused around documentation. So I believe by contributing to that I will learn more about machine learning, and help with a few of their 779 issues! 

## Why this project is meaningful to me (1-3 sentences):

Machine learning is definitely a big topic, but I know almost nothing about it. I would love to get more familiar with a machine learning program. Also, this project was started in a google summer intern program so I would love to be able to say I contributed something that was started at google!

## Why this contribution is meaningful to the project (1-3 sentences):
The project seems to want more documentation. When I scroll through the issues on the github project most of the issues are within documentation. I don't know a thing about machine learning so writing code to help the project might be too much of a leap. I believe I can help the most by fixing documentation errors.
